# laesutkontroll

This program is designed to log into the target web application, retrieve heat sensor data, and save it into CSV files.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Rust and Cargo: You can download and install Rust and Cargo by following the official installation guide at [www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Building

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the program to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/crispshaker/laesutkontroll.git
    cd laesutkontroll
    ```

2. **Build the Program**:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Creating an Executable

Once you have successfully built the program, you can create an executable for *laesutkontroll* by following these steps:

1. **Locate the Executable**:

    After building the program, the compiled executable file will be located in the `target/release` directory within your project folder. The file name will be the same as your project name. In this case, it will be named *laesutkontroll*.

2. **Copy the Executable**:

    Copy the executable to a location of your choice or distribute it as needed. You can also rename the executable to make it more meaningful for your use case.

    ```bash
    cp target/release/laesutkontroll /path/to/destination/
    ```

3. **Make the Executable Executable**:

    If the copied file is not already marked as executable, you can do so using the `chmod` command.

    ```bash
    chmod +x /path/to/destination/
    ```

## Run executable

Upon initial execution, the script will prompt you to input your login credentials, the IP address and the log location, which will then be used to generate a configuration file.

To update the information, modify the config file with the following format:

    Username: john.doe@example.com
    Password: Tr0ub4dor&3
    IP address: 192.168.1.1
    Log location: usr/local/bin/sensor_logs

The script will create multiple CSV files.
